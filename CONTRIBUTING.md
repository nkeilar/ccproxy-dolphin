# Contributing to Grok-Anthropic Proxy

## The Origin Story

This project was born during a late-night Saturday coding session, fueled by curiosity and a killer playlist of 90's electronic music. You know the vibe - The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, and Orbital providing the perfect soundtrack for some experimental proxy hacking.

## Project Status

This is a **weekend experiment** - a proof of concept that emerged from the question "What if we could use Grok with Claude Code?" There's no commitment to maintain this project, but it works and it's here for anyone who finds it useful.

## Contributing

While this isn't an actively maintained project, if you want to:

- **Fork it** - Make it your own!
- **Submit PRs** - I might merge them if they're cool, but no promises on timeline
- **Report issues** - Others might benefit from knowing about them
- **Share improvements** - The community loves creative hacks

## Code Style

The existing code follows the sacred principles of late-night hacking:
- It works
- It's reasonably clean
- It solves the problem at hand

## Ideas for Enhancement

If you're looking to hack on this during your own late-night session:
- Add support for other AI providers
- Implement request caching
- Create a web UI
- Add prometheus metrics
- Make it work with other Claude-compatible tools

## Remember

This was built for fun and learning. Keep that spirit alive if you contribute!
